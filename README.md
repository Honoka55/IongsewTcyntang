# Iongsew Tcyntang
An extended Nüshu font derived from [Noto Traditional Nushu](https://github.com/notofonts/NotoTraditionalNushu).

## Introduction
- Characters are supplemented in the private use area. The supplemental character is a mapping from ID to U+E000 - U+E364. The ID is from 1 to 869, from [this repository](https://github.com/nushu-script/nsbzzzd) based on *Nǚshū Biāozhǔn Zì Zìdiǎn*.
- The characters are not fully supplemented, and only Bold weight is currently available.
- This font was initially intended to display the periodic table of elements in Nüshu script, and here it is:
